# SpookyWebGL Project


### Overview
This WEBGL project allows users to procedurally generate a cemetery scene with various 3D models placed automatically according to predefined rules and patterns.

### Features
- **Procedural Model Placement:** Automatically places gravestones, ghosts and other cemetery-related objects in the scene.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can adjust parameters such as the density of objects, types of models used, and overall layout to create diverse cemetery environments.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** As objects are placed, the scene updates in real-time to reflect changes, ensuring an immersive and responsive experience.


## Objective
Develop a "3D-WebApp" using WebGL (HTML5, CSS, and WebGL context), JavaScript, and GLSL, for the Chrome browser. This is an individual exam project. Collaboration is allowed during the design phase, but not during development.

## Project Description
Design and implement an interactive 3D application featuring at least one primary mesh object loaded from a file (OBJ Wavefront format). Create an appropriate scene by illuminating and texturing the objects. "Shooter" and "maze" type applications are not allowed.

### Mandatory Graphic Requirements
- **3D Geometry:** Displayed in perspective projection.
- **User Input:** Manage 3D interaction using the keyboard, mouse, and optionally a gamepad.
- **Lighting and Shading:** 3D objects must be illuminated by at least one light source.
- **Texture Mapping:** Apply textures to at least two 3D objects, with at least one texture being a photo of the author.
- **Control Panel:** Provide an on-screen control panel using 2D text and graphics to display available options.
- **Mobile Accessibility:** Ensure usability on mobile devices by handling touch events.
- **Advanced Rendering (Optional):** Include a menu option to toggle at least one advanced rendering technique such as shadows, transparencies, reflections, bump mapping, etc.

### Evaluation Criteria
Projects will be evaluated based on the originality of choices (type of application, objects, scene, textures, etc.) and the graphical functionality of the implemented code. The focus is on 3D graphics.

## Submission
Submit a zip archive named `lastname.zip` containing two folders:
1. **project:** Contains the code.
2. **doc:** Contains an HTML report describing the project (application description and usage, explanation of choices made, WebGL functionalities used, special features).

The project archive must be uploaded to the "Consegna Progetti d'Esame" section on virtuale.unibo.it at least 7 days before the exam date, specifically by 12:00 PM. Simultaneously, send an email to the professor informing them of the project upload and indicating the exam session you wish to attend. The estimated time required to complete the project is at least 40 hours.

## Warnings

### Warning 1
You are allowed to "look at" existing code to learn new things, but not to plagiarize! If you find something interesting that works but don't understand why, don't use it; you may be asked to explain it.

### Warning 2
You cannot use libraries other than those provided during the course. However, you are encouraged to use all available resources (glm_utils.js for loading .obj files, mesh_utils.js, webgl-utils.js, m4.js, dat.gui.js, jquery-3.6.0.js).
